       "\"organization prepares to entrench total occupation of place person person person website date The organization has released a trio of chilling organization video clips in which ordinary everyday activities are characterized as signs of potential terrorism, with the public being indoctrinated to assume the role of domestic spies reporting on their friends and neighbors as place sinks deeper into a decaying police state. Following the date implementation of the stasi style quote quote campaign, in which Americans were urged to report quote by means of Orwellian telescreens placed at organization checkouts which played a looped message from person, the organization announced that the program was set to be expanded to include number federal buildings, as well as sports stadiums, businesses and communities in general. We now know how that expansion will manifest itself with Americans at every level of society being trained that activities such as using cash, not having a credit card, taking pictures or video footage, asking questions, and wearing certain items of clothing are all suspicious and should be reported, while being coerced into living in constant fear of terror, when in reality they are more likely to die from peanut allergies, lightning strikes, or accident causing deer than terrorist attacks. organization will no longer be limited to the airport in the form of the organization, but will become a ubiquitous entity policing everyone through a network of citizen spies and infrastructure security technology. The agency will also assume the mantle of regulating Americans' every behavior and activity. organization signs are already in place all over the country telling people where they can and can not park their cars. As we have documented , every historical example of such informant programs illustrates that they never lead to a more secure society, but instead breed suspicion, distrust, fear and resentment amongst the population. The only quote that such programs have ever achieved is allowing the state to more easily identify and persecute political dissidents while discouraging the wider population from engaging in any criticism against the government. n t As we have seen from a myriad of reports put out by the organization and threat fusion centers across the country the primary targets of organization in their campaign to have everyone treated with suspicion are gun owners, people who know their rights, and people who exercise their freedoms. As part of organization, the following organization videos have been released by organization . organization Video No Reservations Extension of quote quote program. This video equates people who use cash or have a distrust of credit cards as suspicious and potential terrorists. organization Video Retail Sector Extension of quote quote program. This video instigates paranoia by turning everyday activity into potential terrorist warning signs. This video shows that anyone attending public events will be under the scrutiny of organization. We'll have more on this chilling organization takeover of society tomorrow, which will see the launch of a new resistance campaign to protest the unraveling occupation of place by federal goon squads. ******************* person person is the editor and writer for person website .

       "'By Reena Flores CBS News November 27, 2016, 10:06 AM Donald Trump rages against Hillary Clinton team over recount efforts in Wisconsin Jill Stein recount attempt in Wisconsin: What you need to know \\nMr. Trump took to his favorite social media platform, Twitter, calling the efforts “sad” and declared that “nothing will change” despite the time and money that will be spent. Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 \\nThe president-elect also mentioned Clinton’s remarks during one presidential debate, when she called it “horrifying” that Mr. Trump was declining to say he would absolutely accept the general election results. Hillary\\'s debate answer on delay: \"That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We\\'ve had free -- — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 and fair elections. We\\'ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a - — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind -- — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 of position.\" Then, separately she stated, \"He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of -- — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy.\" She then said, \"We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald -- — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.\" So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016 \\nOn the Wednesday after the election tallies came in, Clinton, in a concession speech , had urged her supporters to “accept” the results. \\n“Donald Trump is going to be our president,” she said at the time. “We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.” \\nThe tweetstorm early Sunday was a continuation of the president-elect’s rampage Saturday on Stein’s “ridiculous” recount attempts, when he issued a lengthy statement about how the donations -- now amounting to over $6 million -- were just meant to “fill her coffers with money.” \\n“This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing,” he said in a statement issued by his transition team. \\nOn Saturday, Marc Elias, the Clinton campaign’s general counsel, announced that the campaign would “participate” in the Wisconsin recount , for which Stein’s representatives have already filed the paperwork. (If Stein follows through with petitioning for recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, the Clinton campaign also intends to join their efforts in those states.) In Wisconsin, Mr. Trump’s vote margin numbered just over 27,000 ballots. If the three states were to flip to Clinton victories, she would win the general election with 278 electoral votes, though that scenario seems very unlikely. It is rare that recounts change the result of a race. \\nWisconsin’s elections commission is slated to discuss the state’s recount timeline early Monday morning on a conference call with reporters. \\nThe state will be working to complete the recount by the Dec. 13 federal deadline. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.
