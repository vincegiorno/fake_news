       "'Growing up in middle-class white America, I was constantly told, “Don’t judge a book by its cover!” This wasn’t merely a feminist rallying cry; it was a lesson in how to view all sects of society—blacks, nerds, jocks, fat people, rednecks, thugs, et cetera. Of course, we all learned to parrot this doctrine without questioning it, even if we rarely actually followed it. It made sense to us—there’s so much more to a book than the three words written on its cover. To judge a book before reading it would be prejudice, and there is no worse sin for a middle-class white child than to judge another person before truly getting to know them and their circumstances.\\n\\nAssuming blue pill dogma is true, this is at best a false analogy. Covers are designed to market a book. The title and pictures inform you what kind of book it is, and there will likely be a synopsis and genre label on the back. Publishing companies totally want you to judge the book by its cover, hence why they put so much effort into making it catch your eye. If I want to read some bondage erotica, I’m not going to pick a book with a spaceship on the front.\\n\\nHowever, blue pill dogma is heresy. Ubiquitous and mandatory, but heresy nonetheless. Just as you can judge a book by its cover, so too can you judge people based on their physical appearance, because it is by physical appearance that we market ourselves to the world. You wouldn’t wear a t-shirt to a job interview any more than a children’s mystery novel would have a man smoking on it. That’s just not appropriate.\\n\\nThe Myth Of Ugly Women\\n\\nAt this point the casual reader will say, “But people can’t help how they look! It’s not fair!” This is a lie. Few women are naturally ugly. Usually if a woman is ugly, it is something that she’s done to her body such as bad make-up, aberrant piercings, or weight. The blue pill congregant will claim that some people can’t help being fat because of a medical condition, but that is a tiny minority. Most people can do something even though it may require self-discipline.\\n\\nOne of the most essential aspects of a woman’s beauty is her hair. A simple change of hair can radically alter a woman’s beauty. Hair is such a symbol of femininity and sexuality that many cultures have women wear headscarves in public or in religious buildings. Some places are considered to be important enough that women should not be beautiful, either to repel men or to show reverence for the structure’s purpose.\\n\\nWhile it is true that some women are definitely more beautiful than others, most are close to average in their natural state. Maybe a girl is born with bug-eyes or freckles, but there are usually things she can do to offset it. Even if this is not the case, most men will understand that she made an effort in her presentation. That’s the key element—presentation. The way you present yourself to the world says something about the way you want to be judged. And yes, we all want people to judge us. Not a single one of us “just doesn’t care what anyone thinks.”\\n\\nBeing Judgmental\\n\\nI was at a friend’s house a few months back and met her sister-in-law. The girl was in her late 20s, had very short hair, and was covered in tattoos. The worst tattoo by far was of a mustache on the side of her finger, like the kind of drunk frat joke you see on most girls’ Facebook profiles, though without the same permanence. Knowing nothing about this girl, I can tell everything I need to know about her. There is a difference between the woman a man wants to fuck and the woman a man wants to make love to. This girl is a fun person to be around, but is never someone a red pill man would consider committing to because her entire physical appearance screams instability.\\n\\nThe thing about weight is that it’s a sign of health. Women complain about how they’ll never be supermodel-skinny, but most men want to marry a woman whose ribcage they can see.* This is all unconscious animal instinct, and no amount of propaganda in either direction will ever change this reality. It’s also the exact reason women are attracted to strong men. I will probably never need to defend a woman with my fists, but having large muscles is a sign of health. Image-consciousness cuts both ways, and a weak man is equivalent to a fat woman.\\n\\nChoices Have Consequences\\n\\nPrejudice against physical appearance is totally fair. If you choose to have purple hair or a nose ring, know that you are greatly limiting yourself as a long-term relationship candidate. “Yes, but sometimes women may look good like that,” the blue pill congregant argues. No, if a woman looks good with aberrant hair, tattoos or piercings, it’s always in spite of those aberrancies, not because of them.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider, and this is critical, is that men will want to show you off to their friends. If you assume that there exists men who never present women as a trophy wife, then at the least you will meet his family and friends eventually. Like it or not, society has a prejudice against people looking unnatural, even if tacitly. Will a man really want to be the guy with the weird girlfriend? He’ll tell his friends, “Yeah, she’s pretty independent, but…” and then what will he say? She’s good in bed, she’s nice, she likes the Decemberists? Notice there was a “but.” The man likely said that without even thinking. He found your excessive independence repulsive without even realizing it. If you choose to be socially deviant, don’t be surprised when society rejects you.\\n\\nAnd that’s the thing about a bug-eyed girl who attends to her physical appearance. Yes, her eyes are a negative feature, but the way she dresses and styles her hair says a lot about her approach to life. If I’m looking for someone to breed with, I’ll take the girl who seems least likely to screw up my children. Dressing without showing as much skin as legally possible says something about the way you view yourself and those around you, and it says something about what you want out of life. Being fat says you have no self-restraint, and hence it communicates self-centeredness. Having short hair says, “I don’t care what men think about me; I just want to be comfortable.”\\n\\nDemanding to not be judged based on your presentation is 20th century pampering at its most decadent.\\n\\nRead More: You Should Judge Books By Their Covers\\n\\nUpdate: This line is a typo but ultimately is irrelevant. I’ve explained it here.'"

       "\" place modification has drastically changed skies and weather systems across the globe, especially in date. Go anywhere in the world and it's quickly apparent that the same heinous crimes are being committed, and no matter which terms are used chemtrails, geoengineering, solar radiation management , stratospheric aerosol injection , and so on the results are person inspired skies, weird weather and lacklustre light. The skies are streaked, smeared, filled with bizarre cloud formations, white, grey or, at best, a chalky blue. Sunshine is greatly diminished and when it shines it's extremely rare for the earth to be bathed in warm, yellow light. time, a gift for photographers, has all but disappeared. While Sean and I have witnessed countless freakish skies and so called weather anomalies over date, here's number recent example that illustrates how geoengineering is very much the cause of quote . date, we had a very strange shift in weather from very hot to temperate. For the vast majority of my life I've witnessed the natural phenomenon of thunderstorms bringing an abrupt end to heat waves, but thunderstorms are yet another element of naturally occurring weather to be replaced by something entirely unnatural. The temperature was close to quantity celsius , the sky was ostensibly clear and blue with no clouds present, and everyone we met waxed lyrical about the fantastic weather. Thing is, it was nothing like the heatwaves of even a few years ago. The sky was covered in a fine layer of white, turning what would otherwise have been a deep, blue sky into a pale, slightly milky blue. Above the horizon the sky was a grungy blue, and the white sun cast an insipid, cool light. The heat was oppressive, but it was not due to humidity. And yet, despite there being no moisture in the air, it was not a dry heat either. This strange heat with its accompanying barely blue sky continued for date before the temperature plummeted by quantity . There were no thunder claps, no lightning bolts, no downpours, time of heavy spraying. The lines predictably morphed into a light metallic grey blanket that not only covered the entire sky, but also drastically reduced visibility. Trees and hills in the near distance were shrouded in a paler, less dense version of what was occurring above our heads. As a growing number of folk are aware, chemtrails have become ubiquitous throughout the entire world. And while checkerboard or smeared skies sucked, this current phase of weather warfare sucks even more due to the greatly increased number of quote days, the high levels of nanoparticulate heavy metals that prevent the full strength of the sun's rays from reaching the earth, and the prevalence of bizarre quote shaped by ionospheric heaters zapping the sky with radio frequencies / microwaves. Not to mention the toxic air we're all breathing as the DNA damaging nanoparticulates fall to earth, contaminating soil and water, and affecting all plant and animal life. number thing person talks about is a new phase of geoengineering that will block out the sun and stars, however this has clearly been underway for date now given the vastly increased and ever increasing number of days with complete cloud cover. The history of organization is something that's continually been erased as new, updated images replace older ones. organization images are, of course, captured at varying times of date and across date, but what this endeavour does reveal is the extent to which our skies have been perverted and our sunlight drastically diminished. And while certain image captures are ostensibly sunny, the light is inevitably cool and insipid. date Sean and I quote around place in place, place. During the approach the sky and light was typical of date , but when we came up to a barrier and drove through it we found ourselves back in date, prior to the installation of the barrier. organization's organization is a great resource for looking at the sky globally, nationally, or over a discrete area. Here are some examples of a handful of many of the weird cloud formations that can be seen from date. Just click on any of the below images to see them full screen on organization website. Hat tip to person who previously shared a number of these organization images on organization. Beyond aesthetics, geoengineering is the greatest threat to life on earth. Alzheimer's disease and dementia are skyrocketing, person deficiency has reached epidemic proportions, soil and water supplies are contaminated, and the vastly reduced sunlight negatively affects all plant life, including crops that form the foundation of our food supply. Not to mention the steep decline of the bee population bee pupae are being discovered with levels of aluminum that are not only off the charts, but also significantly higher than the levels considered dangerous for human beings. All of these effects and more are being explained away by sell out scientists and meteorologists whose government and corporation backed propaganda is spread to the masses by controlled media companies. This is further reinforced by so called entertainment, advertising, education, and astroturfing, as well as a large number of trolls who are paid to discredit individuals and their work in comment threads and forums. Given how hooked in most people are to the person, subjecting themselves to such a wide array of reinforcing propaganda, it's hardly surprising that the majority response to the subject is cognitive dissonance and denial, something that's almost as great a tragedy as the operation itself. place Whistleblower person, ex military organization, gives a talk on geoengineering. Resonance Experiment a good illustration of how frequencies affect matter, using sand, a tone generator, a wave driver and a metal plate attached to the speaker. place the person and person discuss the impact of geoengineering on the environment. What in organization? person's first documentary on stratospheric aerosol geoengineering. Why in organization? Second documentary from person. Owning the place by date research paper in response to a directive from the chief of staff of the Air organization to examine the concepts, capabilities, and technologies place will require to remain the dominant air and space force in the future. This article is licensed under organization. organization is co founder and editor of organization. In date she unplugged her television and freed herself from brainwashing. As a result, she now sees dots everywhere and connects them in writing. \""
