<h3>
    This demo app will give you a measure of how trustworthy an article is, based on similarities with 
    a large collection of other articles.

        This is intended as a proof of concept, so the unreliability rating is defiitely not intended to be 
        definitive. Rather, the higher the rating â€” on a scale up to 100, the greater the chance 
        that the content is not reliable and you should be cautious about taking it at face value.

        This is a rather basic and limited interface that will not work well or perhaps at all with anything 
        but plain text. Copy and paste an article, or at least several paragraphs, into the text area below and 
        click the submit button. The algorithm removes at least the first and last sentences, and anything in 
        parentheses or brackets. Additionally, it will reduce quotations of any length to a single sentence 
        comprising one or more instances of the word "quote" so that content that is not directly part of the 
        article itself is not used to evaluate the article. An article with an uneven number of (double) 
        quotation marks will not be evaluated, since the algorithm could not accurately determine which words 
        were inside of quotations and which outside. What is left must be at least 10 sentences long, or the 
        algorithm will not perform an evaluation. This is based on the assumption that articles with too few 
        sentences/words do not provide enough of a basis for a reasonable determination of reliability.
